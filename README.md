Tutorial:

  Download repository as a ZIP file
  Extract file to a USB stick
  To use, plug USB into "victim's" computer and run launch.bat
  Wait for all windows to close (should be just a few seconds) and pull your USB stick out
  Voila!

  Extra:
  If you have a USB stick that can emulate a keyboard, you may modify the program so that launch.bat runs as soon as your USB stick is plugged into the computer.
